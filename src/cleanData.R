# I used build_nGram to build bigrams, trigrams and quadgrams. 
# Next I counted the occurances of each.
# I decided to remove all the nGrams that only appear once or twice.
# From looking at the data, it seemed to me that many of them are gibberish or typos
# Also they are less useful for the application, as users are unlikely to use a trigram,
# that only appeared once or twice in this corpus.
# The benefit is performance: It is quicker to do the next steps and run the model
# Finally I sorted them by their frequency. 

# All this took multiple hours on my machine, so I comment it out of the assingment,
# otherwise R will run it again when building the html output, and I don't want that.
