# Data Science Capstone Project
This is the Capstone Project for the Coursera [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), a MOOC by the John Hopkins University, offered through Coursera.
The Capstone Project is the culmination of 10 courses on all things data science.

Students are given a corpus containing multiple million blog posts, news articles, and tweets. The task is to build a text prediction model, similar to what SwiftKey does.

See [here](https://recktenwald.shinyapps.io/TextPredictionApp/) for my result.
